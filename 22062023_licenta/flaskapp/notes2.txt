think of docker image registry
there has to be a docker image push form so the user can push an image to local registry
the chart installs it and kubernetes has to apply the image taken from local registry 

what to do:
frontend 
add a new page add_jeopardy_exercise_toplatform.html where the user has to complete the same fields plus 1, the docker image field
( add a note there too suggesting the user that he can add an image to ctfplatform's image registry )
add a new page Images where the user can see the images from the local repository, he can add an image, delete, update, delete all
update: 
    add_jeopardy_exercise will be for charts which have their image on an online hub, add score field

backend
the discussion is: the user has 2 choices:
--For add_jeopardy_exercise_toplatform.html
-> he can push the image to local image registry:
===> The server has to create imagetable
===> The server has to store imageName,imageTag, fullUrl, inUseBy, CreatedAt, Score, Flag
!*Remember to always update inUseBy when a deployment starts/stops using the image*!
===> The server has to push the image to local registry and wait for success response ( if not alert the user of failure )
===> The chart has to only contain the imageName:imageTag as image ( announce the user )
===> The server has to append the local registry tag to chart imageName before installing it


--For images.html --
===> The server has to get image relevant info from the db and populate Image's page
===> The server has to be able to delete/delete_all an image/images from image registry 
===> The server is already able to push an new image( add )
===> The server has to be able to update an image ( replace the old with the new )

-> he install the chart directly, using an online image 
===> The server has to store imageName,imageTag, fullUrl, inUseBy, Created, Score
!*Remember to always update inUseBy when a deployment starts/stops using the image*!
