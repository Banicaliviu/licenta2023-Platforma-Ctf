Remember you did this while using kaniko : 
kubectl create secret -n ctfspace generic github-secret --from-literal=username=Banicaliviu --from-literal=password=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

Kaniko is a tool to build container images from a Dockerfile, inside a container or Kubernetes cluster. In order to pull from or push to private repositories, you need to provide Kaniko with suitable credentials.

Here is how you can provide GitHub credentials to Kaniko:

    Create a Kubernetes Secret with your GitHub credentials:

You can create a Kubernetes Secret which contains your GitHub username and access token. This command creates a secret named github-secret:

bash

kubectl create secret generic github-secret \
--from-literal=username=<your-github-username> \
--from-literal=password=<your-github-personal-access-token>

    Reference the Secret in your Kaniko Pod definition:

Now that the secret is created, you need to reference it in your Kaniko Pod specification.

The following is an updated version of your provided Kaniko Pod YAML, that uses the github-secret for pulling from GitHub:

yaml

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: kaniko
spec:
  containers:
  - name: kaniko
    image: gcr.io/kaniko-project/executor:latest
    args:
    - "--context=dir://path-to-your-dockerfile-in-git"
    - "--destination=your-container-registry-url"
    - "--dockerfile=Dockerfile"
    env:
    - name: GIT_USERNAME
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: github-secret
          key: username
    - name: GIT_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
          name: github-secret
          key: password
  restartPolicy: Never

In this updated Pod specification, we are using env to set the environment variables GIT_USERNAME and GIT_PASSWORD from the secret github-secret. Kaniko uses these environment variables to authenticate with GitHub.

Remember to replace dir://path-to-your-dockerfile-in-git, your-container-registry-url, <your-github-username> and <your-github-personal-access-token> with your actual values.

The path-to-your-dockerfile-in-git should be the path within your Git repository to the directory containing your Dockerfile. For example, if your Dockerfile is in the root of your repository, you can simply use git://github.com/username/repo.git.

Please note, to access private repositories on GitHub, you should use Personal Access Tokens as the password. These tokens are used instead of a password for Git over HTTPS, or can be used to authenticate to the API or other GitHub services.
